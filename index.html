            <p>Medical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) encompass a new generation of smart medical systems that integrate human, cyber, and physical elements in closed-loop control. They aim to improve patient care by enabling the delivery of advanced therapies and complex surgeries. An example is the artificial pancreas that allows people with diabetes to better manage their condition. Another example is medical robotic systems, which allow doctors to perform minimally-invasive surgeries that were not possible before. Such systems may be integrated into the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) which consist of connected infrastructures of medical devices, mobile and web applications, and other health services. Designing safe and effective Medical CPS and IoMT involves the work of a multi-disciplinary team of engineers, medical domain experts, and human factors specialists. This work needs to be supported by rigorous development processes and tools, as substantial evidence needs to be documented and integrated to justify design choices and ease the review process mandated by regulation.</p>

            <p>The objectives of the Medical Cyber-Physical Systems (MCPS) and Internet of Medical Things workshop 2021 are to provide opportunities for researchers, industrial practitioners, caregivers, and government agencies to demonstrate innovative development methods and tools, present experience reports, discuss open challenges, and explore ideas for future development of Medical CPS and the Internet of Medical Things. Contributions are welcome on all aspects of system development, including specification, design, analysis, implementation, documentation, and certification of Medical CPS. Demonstrations of existing tools for design and analysis of Medical CPS are also encouraged.</p>

            <p>The 11th MCPS workshop will be an one-day virtual event co-located with CPS-IOT Week 2021. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><em><strong>Foundations for Integration of Medical Device Systems/Models:</strong></em> Component-based technologies for accelerated design and verifiable system integration, Systems of systems, Medical devices plug-and-play to support interoperability of heterogeneous systems</li>

                           <p>For researchers, especially in remote health monitoring and ubiquitous computing,
                              it is common to expend a significant amount of time and effort to develop data collection
                              systems that can be used outside of the lab or clinic. These systems tend to be customized
                              and highly specific to the task at hand; thus, they are not general enough to support
                              other tasks. In this paper, we present Raproto, an open-source, easy-to-use rapid
                              prototyping platform that facilitates data collection and visualization from sensors
                              on commercially available, off-the-shelf smartwatches. The Raproto platform consists
                              of three components: the smartwatch, communication protocol, and server. These components
                              support the collection, transmission, storage, analysis, and visualization of data.
                              We evaluate our platform on limiting factors including the smartwatch battery life,
                              data loss during transmission, and data latency. Overall, we find that the smartwatch
                              can last for over 24 hours on a single charge, has little to no data loss, and less
                              than a second of data latency per transmission.</p>

                           <p>Physiological measurements are an integral part of many established and emerging engineering
                              and biomedical applications that involve physiological modeling, physiological state
                              estimation, and physiological closed loop control. In practice, such measurements
                              exhibit a large degree of variability, which is apparent at multiple levels, including
                              disturbances acting on measured signals and unexpected physiological behavior in certain
                              individuals. In this short paper, we present an inference-based approach to estimating
                              the atypicality of an individual's physiological data both at the level of measurement
                              and physiological behavior. For this purpose, we use data from a cohort of subjects
                              to infer, simultaneously, model representations for measurement disturbances and atypicality
                              of physiological behavior. Using a case study on hematocrit (HCT), cardiac output
                              (CO), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) measurements in response to hemorrhage and
                              colloid infusions, we discuss the merits of the presented approach in deriving reliable
                              subject atypicality and signal quality indicators for physiological data.</p>

                           <p>Recent studies suggest that atypical neural function, due to atypical neural structure,
                              is associated with the behavioral symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Additionally,
                              studies suggest that the atypical neural functions and structures associated with
                              ASD change from early childhood to adulthood. This study is the first to develop a
                              multiclass classification model to differentiate neural activity patterns of children
                              and adults with and without ASD depicted by their EEG waveforms. In contrary to the
                              conventional binary classification approaches used in state-of-the-art literature,
                              the multi-class approaches learn the similarity, dissimilarity, common and differentiating
                              patterns among all the categories present in the data. We collected 6 minutes of non-invasive
                              resting-state EEG signals from 105 individuals that include ASD children and adults
                              as well as typical children and adults. Since conventional supervised learning multi-class
                              classifiers suffer from overfitting on limited clinical data, this study employed
                              a few-shot learning mechanism, named prototypical network learning, that is adaptive
                              to limited data and robust against data imbalance issues. Our developed model achieved
                              85% accuracy in multiclass classification. As the next step, we are developing an
                              interpretable machine learning adaptation for prototypical learning to interpret the
                              model inferences and highlight the brain wave patterns indicative of ASD in different
                              stages of development.</p>

                           <p>Some medical implants act autonomously: they assess the current health status of a
                              patient and administer treatment when appropriate. An improper treatment, however,
                              can cause serious harm. Here, the decision logic leading to the treatment relies on
                              data obtained from sensors --- an inherently imperfect medium. Coping with these inaccuracies
                              requires the logic to be <em>robust</em> in the sense that slight perturbations in the measurements do not significantly alter
                              the decision. Determining the extent to which an algorithm is robust automatically
                              does not scale well for complex and opaque components. This is particularly problematic
                              when machine learning is involved. Yet, the analysis is feasible for simpler safety-related
                              components such as a runtime monitor, which observes the system and intervenes in
                              a treatment when necessary. Its significantly lower complexity generally allows for
                              providing static guarantees on the runtime behavior of the monitor. Complementing
                              these guarantees with a robustness analysis constitutes a major step toward certifiable
                              medical cyber-physical systems controlled by opaque, machine-learned components. Hence,
                              this paper reports on ongoing research in the direction of a robustness analysis for
                              the runtime monitoring framework RTLola.</p>

            <p><b>Abstract</b></p>
            <p>Building safe and secure interoperable medical devices with
            accompanying assurance artifacts can often be
            challenging task.  In industry, many start-up companies have great ideas
            for innovation, but are not familiar with appropriate safety/security-critical engineering
            processes, architecture principles, risk management, and assurance
            techniques.  Larger, more experienced, companies may face hurdles in
            re-engineering their devices for interoperability and greater security.
            In academia, researchers often have good techniques for addressing
            some of the issues above, but are not familiar with how a realistic
            medical device is developed and assured.  Building a prototype
            medical device for a classroom project or research work to validate
            proposed techniques is often a huge effort. </p>

            <p>In this talk, I will describe a open-source reference architecture
            developed by Adventium Labs and Kansas State University for
            interoperable medical devices and the Open PCA Pump built using the
            reference architecture and associated hardware.  The Intrinsically
            Secure, Open and Safe Cyber-Physically Enabled, Life-Critical
            Essential Services (ISOSCELES) architecture is a reference
            implementation for future mixed-criticality medical and Internet of
            Things (IoT) system designs.  By the use of a partitioning
            architecture based on hypervisor technology, the reference
            implementation enables manufacturers to focus on the clinical side of
            their product, reducing the time and effort spent ensuring that
            security vulnerabilities in the resulting platform minimize adverse
            impacts on patient safety.  The Open PCA Pump illustrates a full suite
            of realistic development artifacts that academic researchers can
            leverage in their work including use cases, requirements, architecture
            models, verified source code, testing and simulation infrastructure,
            risk management artifacts, and assurance cases.</p>

            <p>This work is sponsored by the US Department of Homeland Security and
