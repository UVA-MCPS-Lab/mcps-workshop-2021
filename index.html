            <p>Medical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) encompass a new generation of smart medical systems that integrate human, cyber, and physical elements in closed-loop control. They aim to improve patient care by enabling the delivery of advanced therapies and complex surgeries. An example is the artificial pancreas that allows people with diabetes to better manage their condition. Another example is medical robotic systems, which allow doctors to perform minimally-invasive surgeries that were not possible before. Such systems may be integrated into the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) which consist of connected infrastructures of medical devices, mobile and web applications, and other health services. Designing safe and effective Medical CPS and IoMT involves the work of a multi-disciplinary team of engineers, medical domain experts, and human factors specialists. This work needs to be supported by rigorous development processes and tools, as substantial evidence needs to be documented and integrated to justify design choices and ease the review process mandated by regulation.</p>

            <p>The objectives of the Medical Cyber-Physical Systems (MCPS) and Internet of Medical Things workshop 2021 are to provide opportunities for researchers, industrial practitioners, caregivers, and government agencies to demonstrate innovative development methods and tools, present experience reports, discuss open challenges, and explore ideas for future development of Medical CPS and the Internet of Medical Things. Contributions are welcome on all aspects of system development, including specification, design, analysis, implementation, documentation, and certification of Medical CPS. Demonstrations of existing tools for design and analysis of Medical CPS are also encouraged.</p>

            <p>The 11th MCPS workshop will be an one-day virtual event co-located with CPS-IOT Week 2021. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><em><strong>Foundations for Integration of Medical Device Systems/Models:</strong></em> Component-based technologies for accelerated design and verifiable system integration, Systems of systems, Medical devices plug-and-play to support interoperability of heterogeneous systems</li>

            <p> <b>A Reference Architecture for Mixed-Criticality Medical Devices with an Exemplar PCA Pump Device </b></p>

            <p><b>Abstract</b></p>
            <p>Building safe and secure interoperable medical devices with
            accompanying assurance artifacts can often be
            challenging task.  In industry, many start-up companies have great ideas
            for innovation, but are not familiar with appropriate safety/security-critical engineering
            processes, architecture principles, risk management, and assurance
            techniques.  Larger, more experienced, companies may face hurdles in
            re-engineering their devices for interoperability and greater security.
            In academia, researchers often have good techniques for addressing
            some of the issues above, but are not familiar with how a realistic
            medical device is developed and assured.  Building a prototype
            medical device for a classroom project or research work to validate
            proposed techniques is often a huge effort. </p>

            <p>In this talk, I will describe a open-source reference architecture
            developed by Adventium Labs and Kansas State University for
            interoperable medical devices and the Open PCA Pump built using the
            reference architecture and associated hardware.  The Intrinsically
            Secure, Open and Safe Cyber-Physically Enabled, Life-Critical
            Essential Services (ISOSCELES) architecture is a reference
            implementation for future mixed-criticality medical and Internet of
            Things (IoT) system designs.  By the use of a partitioning
            architecture based on hypervisor technology, the reference
            implementation enables manufacturers to focus on the clinical side of
            their product, reducing the time and effort spent ensuring that
            security vulnerabilities in the resulting platform minimize adverse
            impacts on patient safety.  The Open PCA Pump illustrates a full suite
            of realistic development artifacts that academic researchers can
            leverage in their work including use cases, requirements, architecture
            models, verified source code, testing and simulation infrastructure,
            risk management artifacts, and assurance cases.</p>
